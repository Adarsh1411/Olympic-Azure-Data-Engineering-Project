**Tokyo Olympics Azure Data Engineering Project:** 

**Project Overview**

This project is designed to process and analyze datasets related to athletes, coaches, entries by gender, medals, and teams. The data is stored in CSV format and ingested, transformed, and analyzed using various Azure services. The final processed data is visualized in Power BI dashboards to derive insights.

**Architecture Overview**

The architecture follows a structured approach using Azure services:
Storage Account: Stores raw and transformed data.
Azure Data Factory: Extracts data from a GitHub repository and loads it into Azure Blob Storage.
Azure Databricks: Performs transformations using PySpark.
Azure Synapse Analytics: Integrates transformed data and creates structured tables.
Power BI: Builds dashboards for data visualization.

**Azure Services Used**

**1. Azure Storage Account**

Created a storage account to manage and store data.
Two containers were created:
raw_data: Stores the initial CSV files.
transformed_data: Stores the processed data after transformations.

**2. Azure Data Factory**

Used Data Factory to extract CSV files from a GitHub repository.
Loaded raw data into the raw_data container in Azure Storage.

**3. Azure Databricks**

Implemented data transformations using PySpark.
Cleaned, filtered, and formatted the data to ensure consistency.
Saved the transformed data into the transformed_data container.

**4. Azure Synapse Analytics**

Integrated transformed data from Data Lake into Synapse.
Created tables in Synapse using the Data Lake table option.
Ensured optimized querying and efficient storage for further analysis.

**5. Power BI**

Connected Power BI to Azure Synapse Analytics.
Created interactive dashboards for insights into:
Athlete performance
Medal counts
Team comparisons
Gender-wise participation
Coach analytics

**Data Processing Steps**

Data Ingestion:

CSV files from the GitHub repository are ingested into Azure Blob Storage.
Data Factory orchestrates the movement of files into the raw_data container.

Data Transformation:

Azure Databricks processes and transforms data using PySpark.
Data cleaning, handling missing values, and formatting are performed.
Transformed data is saved in the transformed_data container.

Data Integration:

Synapse Analytics ingests transformed data from Data Lake.
Tables are created to support structured analysis.

Data Visualization:

Power BI connects to Synapse to fetch structured data.
Dashboards are designed to analyze athlete performance and trends.

**Future Enhancements**

Implement incremental data processing to optimize performance.
Integrate Azure Machine Learning for predictive analytics.
Automate pipeline monitoring using Azure Monitor.
Improve data governance using Azure Purview.

**Conclusion**

This project leverages Azure services to build an end-to-end data pipeline for analyzing athlete datasets. The integration of Data Factory, Databricks, Synapse, and Power BI ensures efficient data processing and visualization, providing valuable insights into athlete performance and related analytics.
